        <font size="3">A dog walks into a bar and hops up on a stool. He looks the bartender in the eye and says, "Hey, guess what? I can talk. Have you ever seen a talking dog before? How about a drink?"
            
            The bartender thinks for a moment and says, "Sure, the toilet's right around the corner."</font>
